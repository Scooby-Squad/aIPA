Bypass Bad Beer Before Buying


## Installation

After forking/cloning the repo, to install dependencies run:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
cd rn-client
npm start
```
 
This will open a browser window from Expo, that will allow you to open the app in either an Android or iOS simulator. To get the experience on your phone, download Expo Client from the App Store (available on both platforms) and scan the QR code.

For the best experience using this app, we recommend running this on iOS simulator, or your iPhone with Expo Client.

## Technologies

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) with [Expo](https://expo.io/tools) - With React Native we were able to build an app that functions on both iOS and Android, and with Expo we were able to test and see our app function before deploying.
